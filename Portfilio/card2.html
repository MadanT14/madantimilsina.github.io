    <h1 class="title"><span>Userflow</span> concerned</h1>
    <p class="part1">Anything I develop is for user and I need to take care how user are interacting to my designs and projects. I am fully aware about how user enters into website, view it and move to another. As a UI designer I create website in such a way that user remains in that particular website for long time</p>
    <div class="imgbox"><img src="./img/./user-flow.jpg" alt=""></div>

    <p class="part2">I will develop such a UI by analysing the proper userflow with beautiful design so that overall general user likes the particular UI that I created and also fulfilling the user for their needs. My designs and creations not only helps to make website interactive, but my designs helps to increase Audience retention</p>
